# BCR_web
The BCR Web aims to organize a collection of lab videos related to animal 
behavior recordings. This project will create a user-friendly platform where users can easily 
search, filter, and retrieve these videos based on various aspects such as research focus, animal 
type, and animal behavior etc. The objective is to enhance the accessibility and usability of these 
valuable animal recording media, and encourage related users to share any valuable resource 
with us.
