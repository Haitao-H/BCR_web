        <h1>About BCR</h1>
        <h4>The Biomimetic and Cognitive Robotics (BCR) lab conducts research into the neural, ecological and behavioral foundations of intelligence. Closely paralleled animal and robot studies are conducted to quantitatively evaluate alternative explanations for the intelligent behavior of biological systems. Because of several technical advantages our studies have historically focused on marine invertebrates. Research in this interdisciplinarv area contributes to our knowledge of biology, psychology, artificial intelligence, fluid mechanics and robotics. The primary aim of this research is understanding biological mechanisms of behavior and secondary aim is the development of new tehnologies inspired by animal abilities.</h4>
